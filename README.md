how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:

## Self-Reflection:
I followed this tutorial:https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-make-a-mario-style-platformer-with-phaser-3/

used this video to add sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxauX7VpaAU&list=PL9iYZZWgVwse7tvjCHtlM_MZmUb31lSOl&index=7

Sound from:
https://freesound.org/people/ProjectsU012/sounds/341695/
https://freesound.org/people/jalastram/sounds/386656/

I felt much more comfortable using Phaser this time since the tutorial didn't
need as many changes, no problems like config previously, just needed to add jump and then fix sound.

### How long it took me to finish this?

Around 1.5 hours
